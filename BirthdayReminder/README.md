## Setup Instructions

1. **Import Blueprint**: Copy the blueprint YAML file to your Home Assistant blueprints folder
2. **Create Automation**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Automations & Scenes ‚Üí Create Automation ‚Üí Use Blueprint
3. **Configure Birthday Data**: Enter your birthday list in JSON format
4. **Set Notification Service**: Choose your preferred notification method (e.g., `notify.mobile_app_yourphone`)
5. **Optional Settings**: Configure media player, presence detection, and timing preferences
6. **Save and Test**: Enable the automation and test with a near-future birthday

## Supported Notification Services

- **Mobile Apps**: `notify.mobile_app_yourphone`
- **Persistent Notifications**: `notify.persistent_notification`
- **Email**: `notify.email`
- **TTS/Alexa**: `tts.google_translate_say`, `notify.alexa_media`
- **Telegram**: `notify.telegram`
- **And many more**: Any Home Assistant notify service

## Media Player Integration

If you configure a media player, the blueprint will:
- Play a random song from your birthday songs list
- Only trigger on the actual birthday (day 0)
- Add a 10-second delay before playing music
- Support any Home Assistant media player entity

## Presence Detection

Configure an optional presence entity to only send notifications when someone is home:
- **Person entities**: `person.john_doe`
- **Device trackers**: `device_tracker.johns_phone`
- **Binary sensors**: `binary_sensor.someone_home`
- **Input booleans**: `input_boolean.home_mode`

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Notification Times
The blueprint checks for birthdays at three configurable times:
- **Morning** (default: 07:30)
- **Midday** (default: 12:00) 
- **Evening** (default: 18:30)

### Birthday Music Playlist
Provide a comma-separated list of songs or media content IDs:
```
Happy Birthday Song, Birthday Celebration Music, Birthday Wishes, spotify:track:xyz
```

### Age Calculation
The blueprint automatically:
- Calculates the correct age for each birthday
- Handles year transitions properly
- Uses proper ordinal suffixes (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.)
- Accounts for birthdays that have already passed this year

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Notifications**: Check if presence entity is configured and someone is marked as home
2. **Wrong Age**: Verify birth year in the date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. **Music Not Playing**: Ensure media player entity exists and birthday songs are configured
4. **JSON Error**: Validate your birthday data JSON format

### Testing

To test the blueprint:
1. Temporarily change a birth date to tomorrow's date
2. Wait for the next notification time
3. Check that notifications are received
4. Restore the original birth date
