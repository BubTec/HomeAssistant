## Configuration

### Time Schedule

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Night Mode Start Time** | When quiet hours begin | 22:00 |
| **Night Mode End Time** | When quiet hours end | 07:00 |
| **Active Days** | Days when automation runs | Every Day |
| **Custom Days** | Specific days (if Custom selected) | None |

### Echo Device Configuration

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Echo Volume Entities** | Specific Echo entities (empty = auto-discover) | Auto-discover |
| **Ignored Echo Devices** | Echo entities to exclude | None |
| **Ignore Patterns** | Device name patterns to ignore | Empty |

### Volume Configuration

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Night Mode Volume** | Volume during quiet hours (%) | 20 |
| **Day Mode Volume** | Volume during normal hours (%) | 40 |
| **Special Echo Device** | Echo with different volume levels | None |
| **Special Night Volume** | Special Echo night volume (%) | 30 |
| **Special Day Volume** | Special Echo day volume (%) | 80 |

## Setup Examples

### Basic Automatic Night Mode

Blueprint Configuration:
- **Night Mode Start**: 22:00
- **Night Mode End**: 07:00
- **Active Days**: Every Day
- **Echo Volume Entities**: (leave empty for auto-discovery)
- **Night Mode Volume**: 15
- **Day Mode Volume**: 50

This will automatically:
- At 22:00: Set all Echos to 15% volume
- At 07:00: Set all Echos to 50% volume
- Runs every day

### Weekdays Only Configuration

Blueprint Configuration:
- **Night Mode Start**: 23:00
- **Night Mode End**: 06:30
- **Active Days**: Weekdays Only
- **Night Mode Volume**: 10
- **Day Mode Volume**: 60

Perfect for work schedules - quiet at night on weekdays only.

### Advanced Configuration with Special Device

```yaml
# Blueprint Configuration
Night Mode Start: 22:30
Night Mode End: 07:30
Active Days: Custom
Custom Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday
Ignore Patterns:
  basement
  garage
  outdoor
Special Echo Device: media_player.schlafzimmer_echo
Special Night Volume: 5    # Very quiet in bedroom
Special Day Volume: 30     # Still quieter than others during day
```

### Weekend Sleep-in Mode

Blueprint Configuration:
- **Night Mode Start**: 23:30
- **Night Mode End**: 09:00  
- **Active Days**: Weekends Only
- **Night Mode Volume**: 10
- **Day Mode Volume**: 45

Later quiet hours and sleep-in time for weekends.

## How It Works

1. **Time Triggers**: 
   - At night mode start time ‚Üí Sets all Echos to night volume
   - At night mode end time ‚Üí Sets all Echos to day volume
2. **Day Filter**: Only runs on selected days (weekdays, weekends, or custom selection)
3. **Echo Discovery**: 
   - Uses manual selection if provided
   - Auto-discovers all Alexa Media Player integration devices
4. **Ignore Processing**: 
   - Removes entities from ignore list
   - Applies pattern-based filtering (room names, device names)
5. **Volume Control**: 
   - Normal Echos get night/day volume based on time
   - Special Echo gets custom volume levels
   - Uses `media_player.volume_set` service with proper 0.0-1.0 scaling

## Auto-Discovery Details

The blueprint automatically finds Echo entities from Alexa Media Player integration:
```jinja2
# Examples of entities that will be found:
media_player.badezimmer_echo
media_player.echo_kitchen
media_player.alexa_bedroom
media_player.buero_echo_dot
```

Search criteria:
- Domain is **media_player**
- Integration is **alexa_media**
- Automatically filtered in device selector

## Volume Control Service

### Alexa Media Player Devices
```yaml
service: media_player.volume_set
target:
  entity_id: media_player.badezimmer_echo
data:
  volume_level: 0.25  # 0.0-1.0 scale (25%)
```

The blueprint automatically converts percentage (0-100) to the required 0.0-1.0 scale.

## Advanced Features

### Ignore Patterns

Ignore specific rooms or device types:
```
basement      # Ignores: *basement*
outdoor       # Ignores: *outdoor*
garage        # Ignores: *garage*
b√ºro          # Ignores: *b√ºro*
```

### Random Delays

Prevents command conflicts:
- Configurable 1-30 second maximum delay
- Each Echo gets a random delay between 0-max seconds
- Special Echo gets fixed delay (default 15 seconds)

### Special Device Handling

Perfect for main/master Echos that need different behavior:
- Bedroom Echo stays quieter even in "day" mode
- Kitchen Echo gets louder for cooking timers
- Study Echo for work calls needs different levels

## Day Selection Options

### Predefined Options
- **Every Day**: 7 days a week
- **Weekdays Only**: Monday-Friday
- **Weekends Only**: Saturday-Sunday

### Custom Selection
Choose any combination of days:
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday only
- Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday
- Any custom pattern you need

## Alexa Media Player Integration

### Installation

Install via HACS:
```
1. Go to HACS ‚Üí Integrations
2. Search for "Alexa Media Player"
3. Install and restart Home Assistant
4. Configure with your Amazon account
```

### Expected Entities

Your Echo devices will create entities like:
```
media_player.badezimmer_echo
media_player.buero_echo_dot
media_player.eingang_echo
media_player.kinderzimmer_echo_show
media_player.schlafzimmer_echo_dot
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Echo devices found:**
- Check if Alexa Media Player integration is working
- Verify devices appear as media_player entities
- Check Developer Tools ‚Üí States for available entities
- Try manual entity selection instead of auto-discovery

**Some Echos don't respond:**
- Check device names in ignore patterns
- Verify entities exist and are available in Developer Tools
- Ensure Echo devices are online in Alexa app
- Check if devices support volume control

**Wrong timing:**
- Verify time zone settings in Home Assistant
- Check that Active Days selection matches your needs
- Use Developer Tools ‚Üí Events to monitor automation triggers

### Debugging

Enable debug logging:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.automation: debug
    custom_components.alexa_media: debug
```

Check discovered Echo entities in Developer Tools ‚Üí Template:
```jinja2
{% set found_echos = [] %}
{% for entity in states.media_player %}
  {% if state_attr(entity.entity_id, 'integration') == 'alexa_media' %}
    {% set found_echos = found_echos + [entity.entity_id] %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{{ found_echos }}
```

## Migration from Entity-Based Triggers

If you previously used entity-based triggers (like input_boolean helpers), this blueprint now has built-in time triggers. Benefits:

| Old Method | New Method | Benefit |
|------------|------------|---------|
| input_boolean.night_mode | Built-in time triggers | No extra helpers needed |
| Separate time automations | Integrated time schedule | Simpler setup |
| Manual entity selection | Alexa integration filter | Better device discovery |
| number/input_number entities | media_player entities | Proper Alexa control |
